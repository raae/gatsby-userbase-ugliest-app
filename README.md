# Ugliest Gatsby + Userbase Todo App

This is an example of how to use
[Userbase](https://userbase.com/)
with [Gatsby JS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

The inspiration comes from Userbase own [vanilla JS example](https://github.com/encrypted-dev/userbase-samples/blob/master/ugliest-todo/index.html).

I have intentionally not user the React Context and tried to keep the whole projects #codenewbie friendly with some comments and the use of `console.log` to make it easier to follow along on what is happening. We'll see if it gets the thumbs up from @olavea...
